Dynamic Track Editor

This is an Open Rails route editor that uses dynamic track for all track
except switches.  I've been using it to build the route in my stjlc repository.
As is it will only work for routes developed from scratch using it.  A lot
of route information is saved in a json file which is exported to the
.tdb and world files by the Save to Route feature.  Some features might
only work for the stjlc.

See help at the bottom of main page (dte.html).

This program is designed to be run with NW.js which is available at
https://nwjs.io.  Testing was done using NW.js v0.33.4.
